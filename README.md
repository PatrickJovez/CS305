Project 2


Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

My client for this project was Artemis Financial, a consulting company that wants to provide a secure online application for their clients to use. They required secure connection, strong encryption and coding practices. The issue that the company had was the vulnerabilities found when doing a dependency check. 


What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I documented all my findings and cross checked for false positives as well. The importance of to code securely is paramount, especially when dealing with highly sensitive personal information. Software security is of the utmost importance for Artemis Financial as they're business is ensuring secure transfers of personal information and archiving said information. Having competent and secure software enables trust to be built between the company and its clients. 



Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The challenging part of this vulnerability assessment was implementing the Checksum and Hash Controller classes. 




How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?





How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?




What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?






Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
